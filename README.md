# Causality--Transfer-entropy


In this paper, we examine the impact of El Ni˜no and La Ni˜na weather episodes
on the realized variance of three agricultural commodity prices. First, we employ three methods for feature selection: Transfer Entropy for capturing non-linear
relationships, Backward Stepwise Regression, and Lasso for identifying linear relationships between El Ni˜no and La Ni˜na events and realized variance (RV). Then,
we use both linear and non-linear predictive models to detect relationships between
RV and other features, especially at longer forecast horizons, for several agricultural
commodities studied in this research.
